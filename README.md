# An RMarkdown report template

This project is meant to serve as a "quick start" for short [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) PDF reports, such as those done for coursework.
It's aimed at those of us that want to write a report without much fuss but still be able to have advanced features like citations and code listings.

## How to

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install this package with `devtools::install()`.
3. In RStudio, use `New File` > `RMarkdown` > `From Template`
4. Edit the files however you like and compile the report with RStudio.

## FAQ

### The bibliography style is commented and there's no CSL. Why is this?

There's many good CSL files over at <https://github.com/citation-style-language>, but they are licensed with a CreativeCommons ShareAlike license.
I don't really want to license this project under that, since it's meant to be used as a starter for various projects, so you'll have to download it yourself.
